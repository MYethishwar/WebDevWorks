## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a series of elements (like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.) that tell web browsers how to display content. Each element is represented by a tag enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<p>` for paragraphs or `<img>` for images.

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page. It allows you to define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning for HTML elements. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them using rules, which consist of selectors and declarations.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to manipulate HTML elements, handle events (like clicks or mouse movements), and communicate with servers to fetch or send data without reloading the entire page. JavaScript is often used for tasks like form validation, animations, creating interactive games, and building web applications.
