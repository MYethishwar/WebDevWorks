======== Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) =========

There are Three ways to add CSS to Html code
1, Inline --> Targeted to single element

<h1 style="color: blue;">Style Me in Blue!</h1>

2, Internal --> Targeted to Single Web page

  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>

3, ExternaL --> Targeted to Multipage Websites

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
style.css: html { 
		  color:blue;
                 }

--------------- CSS Selectors ----------------

1, Element selector:-  Target elements based on their html tag elements.

p {
    color: blue;
}

2, Class selector:- Target elements based on the value of the class element.

.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

3, ID selector:- Target elements based on the value of the id attribute 

#header {
    font-size: 24px;
}

4, Attribute selector:- Target elements based on their attributes and values.

input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid black;
}

5, Universal selector:- targets all elements.

* {
  properties here
    }


------------------- Font Properties ------------------------
1,Font Size:- 
	1px = 1/96th of inch
	1pt = 1/72th of inch	
	1em = 100% of parent (head element)
	1rem = 100% of Root parent (html element) 
2,Font weight:- 
	normal
	bold
	lighter
	bolder
	any number(100 - 900)
*3,Font Family:-
	The general font family which is used is sans-serif or serif preceeding with helvetica
4,Text align:-
	center 
	right	
	left

------------------ Inspecting CSS file in browser -------------------------
----> Command that allows you to  directly open CSS code:- (Ctrl + Shift + I)
-> Click on the Three dots located at the right cornor.
-> Inside that there is a option called more tools Click.
-> Here we see option called Developer Tools.
We can also use by clicking directly right click ->  inspect.

------------------------- The CSS Box model --------------------------------------
1, border:- border: size style color;
	border-left, border-right, border-top, border-bottom.
2, margin:- size;
3, padding:- size;

Note:- We can also write like this for all box models  [border size of top size of right size of bottom size of left(clock wise direction]


------------------------- CSS cascade -----------------------------

-> Cascade means nothing but a waterfall if we assign a property for an element twice or trice which one is considered first and which one is next that is cascade
---> It is determined by four parts:
1, Poistion:
	li {
	‚û°Ô∏ècolor:blue;
	‚û°Ô∏ècolor:red;  <--- Considered and applied.
2,Specificity:
	‚û°Ô∏èelement selector
	‚û°Ô∏èClass selector
	‚û°Ô∏èAttribute Selector
	‚û°Ô∏èId selector  <--- Considered and applied.
3,Type:
	‚û°Ô∏èExternal
	‚û°Ô∏èInternal
	‚û°Ô∏èInline  <--- Considered and applied.
4,Importance:
	‚û°Ô∏ècolor: red;
	‚û°Ô∏ècolor: blue !important;   <--- This key word makes this line to be considered no matter if the other types are come ahead.

------------------------- Combine CSS Selectors ----------------------------
1, Group: selector, selector   (We can select group of classes or Id selectors or element selectors at a time)
2, Child: selector > selector (The child selector targets elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.)
3, Descendent: selector selector   (The descendant selector targets elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specified parent element, regardless of how deep they are nested.)
4, Chaining: selectorselector   ( To select more accurate constraints.)
5, Combining combiners: selector selctorselector    (It is like a hybrid selector)

------------------------- CSS Positioning -------------------------------
1,Static: Default position 
2,Relative: Position  which is displaced from the static position.
3,absolute: Position relative to nearest positions ancestor.(By default Left cornor).
*Z-index :- Imagine 3D graph where we can mention depth of the containers here.
4,Fixed: Relative to the top left cornor of the browser window.(Even if we scorll up and down it is not going to move it's place.

------------------------ CSS Display --------------------------------------
There are three main different values for display property ...
Syntax: display: block or inline or block-inline.
1Ô∏è‚É£, Block  <---- Which takes all line of the web page and we can specify height and width.
2Ô∏è‚É£, Inline <---- Takes up as much space as necessary as per the content inside.
3Ô∏è‚É£, Inline-block  <---- combination of first two.(It means the block Don't start in the new line)

------------------------- CSS Float -----------------------------------------
It is a property which makes image to stick right or left side of the web page.
-> This is used when we want a paragraph surrounded by a image on the right side and also below of that image.
CSS clear property :- It is used to clear the contents what ever is present in the left or right or both. Example:- arranging footer at the bottom of the webpage.

	
------------------- How to create responsive websites ----------------------
Responsive Website:- Organize the web in any type of screen sizes like Tablet, Laptop, Mobile Phone.
To make our website responsive we have 4 techniques or type
1Ô∏è‚É£, Media queries
2Ô∏è‚É£, CSS grid
3Ô∏è‚É£, CSS Flexbox
4Ô∏è‚É£, External Frameworks Eg. Bootstrap

------------------------- Media Queries(@media) ---------üîó---------------------
Syntax:
@media (max-width: 600px) and (min-width: 200px){
	#Screens which is visible when the above condition gets satisfied.
}
‚û°Ô∏è We can use multiple media queries in one web page.	
‚û°Ô∏è object-fit: cover; (image or video is fully occupied in  a container extra part is wiped out)	

------------------------- Flex Box ---------------------------------
üòäFlex display:- by declaring display = flex in a container it makes all the blocks in the container in a row systematically
üòäFlex Direction:- by default the flex items are organized in a row(left to right) but in order to make it column wise(top to bottom) we declare value as a column.
üòäFlex-basis:- It is like a height of a flex element in case of flex-row, it will control width. In case of flex-column it will control height.
                               üòäFlex-Layoutüòä
‚ù§Ô∏èorder:- By default the order of each child flex item is 0 so based on the number it is placed accordingly.it is like indexing the flex elements as per requirement.
‚ù§Ô∏èFlex-wrap:- When the child items exceeds the page then if we declare flex-wrap to wrap then it directs bottom to the web page.
‚ù§Ô∏èJustify-content:- It is controlled in Main axis.
	- flex-start (aligns at the start)
	- center (aligns at the center)
	- flex-end (aligns at the end)
	- space between (generates space between the items ignoring around)
	- space around (occupies off space at the start and the end)
	- space evenly (occupies equal space between items)
‚ù§Ô∏èalign-items:- It is controlled in cross axis.
	mention viewport height under the align-items property In order to increase background container. 
	- flex-start
	- flex-end
	- baseline
	- center
	- stretch
-> align-self:- is used to modify the child item or a specific item either to align start, end or center...
‚ù§Ô∏èalign-content- the properties are active to the wrapped items.
                                üòäFlex-sizingüòä
üåªPRIORITY LIST:- [content-width < width < flex-basis < (min-width/max-width).]üåª

üíúBy default max-width is the length of the sentence.
üíúmin-width is the length of the longest word in that that sentence.
üíúmax-width is the value which works as even if there is a space to grow the flex-elements it is not going to grow it will stop with that specified value.
üíúMin-width determines that the how small each of the items can shrink to.
                                üòäGrow and shrinküòä
‚ù§Ô∏èflex-grow:- it means that the flex item can grow proportionally to the available space along the main axis of the flex container. 
‚ù§Ô∏èflex-shrink:- When you assign a value to flex-shrink, it determines how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other flex items in the container when there's not enough space along the main axis.
üåªShort form :- flex: 1(grow) 1(shrink) 0(flex-basis);

------------------------------- GRID -----------------------------------------
üíöSo in order to make our website more responsive we use Grid types layout.
üíöWe can use combinations like Grid inside a flex or Flex inside a grid to achieve a task efficiently.
				üòäGrid - sizingüòä
üíöBelow are the different type of values defined to achieve a particular task.
üîóhttps://appbrewery.github.io/grid-sizing/
.container {
1Ô∏è‚É£display: grid;  //To make a container to follow grid layout.
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;    //defining the ratio as a fraction unit defining along width.
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;	   //defining row-wise height.  
  gap: 15px;     //gap between the grid items.
}   //It is going to maintain that defines ratio of screen size in case if we have content also it will adjust accordingly.

2Ô∏è‚É£,grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;  //we can mention fixed size bsut it the grid items are not going to behave responisively.
   grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;

3Ô∏è‚É£,grid template: 100px 200px / 200px 300px; //Shortcut to minimize the above two lines of code.

4Ô∏è‚É£,grid-template-rows: 100px auto;  //The firsit row will occupy 100px and second one is based on it's content.
   grid-template-columns:100px auto; //The first column will occupy the 100px size and second one will take wholw web.

5Ô∏è‚É£,grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; 
   grid-template-columns: 100px minmax(300px, 500px);   //The second column will shrink of minimum size 300px and max of 500px.

6Ô∏è‚É£,grid-template-rows: 100px repeat(2, 200px);  //It means 200px 200px
   grid-template-columns: 100px repeat(3, 500px); //It means 300px 300px 300px

üíöWe can mention grid-auto-rows or columns to specify the size of the grid item which is exluded in the defined layout.
				üòäGrid - Placementüòä
‚û°Ô∏è	[ grid-coulumn: span 2; ]-> it is going to adjust the first cell by combining the size of the second column and move the second column to the right.
-> It is same for row also.
‚û°Ô∏è [ grid-column-start: 1; ]-> it is going to start from the 1st line.
‚û°Ô∏è [ grid-column-end: 4; ]-> and going to end at the fourth line.
üìù We can also define negative numbers which starts from the right side of the grid just like pythonn list indexing.
üìù Just like flexbox in grid also we have order. if we make a grid cell with max order number then it is going to occupy bottom left place.
‚û°Ô∏èInstead of writing these blocks below 
grid-column-start: 1;   ]
grid-column-end: 2;     |--> grid-area: 3 / 1 / 4 / 2;
grid-row-start: 3;      |
grid-row-end: 4;        ]
